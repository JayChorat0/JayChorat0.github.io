  prompt: `You are a creative cybersecurity expert and game designer. Your task is to generate a new, unique, and solvable puzzle for the "Bug Hunters" detective game.

The puzzle must fit the cyber-sleuth theme of the game. It should be challenging but fair. The solution MUST be discoverable within the puzzle's content. Do not create puzzles that require external knowledge or guessing.

Here are the requirements for the puzzle you create:
1.  **Originality**: The puzzle, especially the solution, must be unique. Avoid using any of the following existing solutions: {{{jsonStringify existingSolutions}}}
2.  **Context**: The last case the user played was about: "{{lastCaseDescription}}". You can use this for inspiration, but it's not a strict requirement.
3.  **Content is Key**: The answer must be findable within the 'content' field. For example, hide it in an HTML comment, a fake URL, a base64 encoded string, a log file, or a code snippet.
4.  **Clarity**: The 'prompt' should clearly state what the user needs to find, without giving away the answer.
5.  **Difficulty**: Assign points based on the perceived difficulty (50 for easy, 100 for medium, 150-200 for hard).

Please generate a new puzzle now.`,
